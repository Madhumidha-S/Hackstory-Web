# Hackstory Web

**Hack the Past. Host the Truth.**

Hackstory Web is an immersive historical storytelling website that brings lesser-known or marginalized events from history to life through interactive, scroll-based narrative design. This project was built as part of the Hackstory Hackathon — blending web design, digital history, and social awareness.

## What This Story Is About

> **Story Focus**: _Noor Inayat Khan — The Spy Princess_

This project tells the story of **Noor Inayat Khan**, an Indian-origin British spy and wireless operator in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. Despite her background as a Sufi pacifist and a writer of children’s books, Noor became one of the bravest undercover agents in the Special Operations Executive (SOE).

Captured and executed at the Dachau concentration camp in 1944, her story of resistance, courage, and sacrifice remained hidden from popular history. This website aims to shine a light on her life and honor her legacy — a story of silence, strength, and truth.
